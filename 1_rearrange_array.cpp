/ * Given an array of size N . The elements in array are in range between 0 to N-1 .( i.e 0 <= A[i] < N ) . We  Have to rearrange array such that A[i] = A[A[i]] without using extra 
space .  

complexities :
  Time  Complexity = O(N)
  Space Complexity  = O(1) 
  
  Example inputs  :
        
        input  =  4 0 2 1 3 
        output =  3 4 2 0 1
